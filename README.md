# Ctrl-P 2.0
An object-oriented approach to doing pressure control. Hopefully things are modular and can be swapped in an out for different controllers and valve setups.

## Updates from version 1.x

### Prefix/suffix support for pre-built trajectories

1. Firmware
	- separate trajectory into "prefix", "suffix", and "looping" parts.
	- update firmware to take in start indices for each part + # of cycles (with -1 = inf cycles, 0 = skip loop, 1--N = # of cycles)
	- add dynamic "# of cycles" function
	- add dynamic speed multiplier function (with error checking to make sure we never divide by 0 or have traj. with 0 time)

2. Python:
	- update buidtraj function to save prefix/suffix parts
	- update sendprebuilt function to send relevant parts + indices
	- update runprebuilt to send speed + # cycles.
